# PowerBIAnalysis_StudentLife_Northeastern
Analyzing Northeastern University student life via Power BI, focusing on dining satisfaction, activity involvement, and recommendations. Visualizations offer insights for enhancements.

The project, titled "Student Life at Northeastern University," focuses on analyzing various aspects of student life through a Power BI dashboard. The primary aim is to provide insights into students' satisfaction with dining options, cultural and entertainment choices, time spent on activities like co-op, extracurriculars, and campus recreational activities, and their likelihood of recommending Northeastern to others. Inputs for the analysis include ratings of dining options, top-selling products at on-campus dining facilities like Popeyes, student satisfaction rates with cultural and entertainment offerings, the number of hours students dedicate to different activities, and data on students' recommendations of the university.

The Power BI dashboard showcases the results of this analysis through various visualizations. For instance, it presents the average rating of dining options, with Starbucks and Tatte Bakery & Cafe receiving the highest ratings, whereas Kigo Kitchen is rated the lowest. It also highlights that sandwiches are the top-selling product at Popeyes, despite a decline in sales. Furthermore, the dashboard indicates that while most students are satisfied with cultural and entertainment options, there's a significant variance in satisfaction levels. Importantly, it reveals that students spend more time on co-op activities than on extracurricular or recreational ones, and a majority are likely to recommend Northeastern, with few in the neutral or unlikely categories. This comprehensive Power BI analysis enables stakeholders to understand the nuances of student life at Northeastern and identify areas for improvement or further investigation.
